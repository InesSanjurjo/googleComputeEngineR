Follows are some R scripts for common workflows.  They assume you have previously signed up and setup a Google project and authentication.

## An RStudio Server for your team

```r
library(googleComputeEngineR)

## setting up a 13GB RAM instance 
## see gce_list_machinetype() for options of predefined_type
vm <- gce_vm(template = "rstudio-hadleyverse",
             name = "rstudio-team",
             username = "mark", password = "mark1234",
             predefined_type = "n1-highmem-2")

## wait a bit, login at the IP it gives you

## add users
gce_rstudio_adduser(vm, username = "bill", password = "flowerpot")

## install packages by logging into RStudio and installing via UI
## use the Terminal in RStudio if required to install dependencies
## or use docker_cmd

## example install crontab on instance
docker_cmd(vm, "exec", args = c("rstudio", "sudo apt-get crontab"))

## see the containers running on the instance
cons <- containers(vm)
cons
## the template RStudio container is called "rstudio"

## once setup, save the RStudio container for quick start in another instance
gce_save_container(vm, 
                   container_name = "my_rstudio",
                   image_name = "rstudio")

## stop the VM when not in use to save bills
gce_vm_stop(vm)

## start up another VM with different configuration from your saved docker container

## start a 50GB RAM instance
## containers need to be launched in "google-containers" image_family pre-loaded with docker
vm2 <- gce_vm(name = "rstudio-big",
              predefined_type = "n1-highmem-8",
              image_project = "google-containers",
              image_family = "gci-stable")

## wait for it to launch

## load and run the container, mapping RStudio port of 8787 to 80
gce_load_container(vm2, "my_rstudio", "-p 80:8787")

## make sure to stop this one, it will be more expensive
gce_vm_stop(vm2)

```

## A remote R cluster to run big R programs

```r
library(future)
library(googleComputeEngineR)

## names for your cluster
vm_names <- c("vm1","vm2","vm3")

## create the cluster using the package's default cloud-config template for r-base
## you may want to make your own cloud-config file
## creates jobs that are creating VMs in background
jobs <- lapply(vm_names, function(x) {
    gce_vm_container(file = system.file("cloudconfig", "r-base.yaml",  package = "googleComputeEngineR"),
                     predefined_type = "n1-highmem-2",
                     name = x)
                     })
jobs
# [[1]]
# ==Operation insert :  PENDING
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:52:58
# [[2]]
# ==Operation insert :  PENDING

# [[3]]
# ==Operation insert :  PENDING
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:53:09

## check status of jobs
lapply(vms, function(x) gce_get_zone_op(x$name))
# [[1]]
# ==Operation insert :  DONE
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:52:58
# Ended: 2016-11-16 06:53:14 
# Operation complete in 16 secs

# ==Operation insert :  DONE

# Ended: 2016-11-16 06:53:20

# Started:  2016-11-16 06:53:09
# Ended: 2016-11-16 06:53:30 
# Operation complete in 21 secs

## get the VM objects
vms <- lapply(vm_names, gce_vm)

## set up SSH for the VMs
vms <- lapply(vms, gce_ssh_setup)

## make a future object
plan(cluster, workers = as.cluster(vms))

## use %<-% to send functions to work on cluster
## See future README for details: https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future
a %<-% Sys.getpid()

## make a big function to run asynchronously
f <- function(my_data, args){
   ## ....expensive...computations
   
   result
}

## send to cluster
result %<-% f(my_data) 

## check if resolved
resolved(result)

## shutdown instances when finished
lapply(vms, gce_vm_stop)

```
