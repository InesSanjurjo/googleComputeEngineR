# Self-contained Shiny app

This creates a dedicated Docker container that has all the libraries, files and scripts necessary to run your Shiny app. 
This example uses a local `Dockerfile` to install the libraries you need, 
but in addition also copies your Shiny app scripts so its all self-contained and portable. 

The Shiny app can then be deployed on new instances.

In summary:

1. Create a Dockerfile in build folder, including copying the Shiny app into the Docker image
2. Create your Shiny app and place in subfolder of your build folder
3. Start up a Shiny templated Google Compute Engine VM
4. Deploy and push to the Google Container Registry via `gce_shiny_addapp`
5. Enjoy your Shiny app

Once built, you can deploy straight from the Container Registry, so not necessarily needing steps 1 and 2.  

## Google Container Registry - Build Triggers

Alternativly, you can use build triggers from [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/) to build the docker image.  

This is typically done by pushing up to a GitHub repository with your Dockerfile, which [triggers a build](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/concepts/creating-build-triggers).  You can then call this docker image directly using `gce_shiny_addapp`.

## Create a Dockerfile in build folder, including copying the Shiny app into the Docker image

The `Dockerfile` also includes a `COPY` command to copy necessary Shiny `ui.R` and `server.R` files into the Docker image. 

The Shiny app used is the [`googleAuthR` demo app](https://mark.shinyapps.io/googleAuthRexample/), and the build directory can be found via: `get_dockerfolder("shiny-googleAuthRdemo")`

```sh
FROM rocker/shiny
MAINTAINER Mark Edmondson (r@sunholo.com)

# install R package dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libssl-dev \
    ## clean up
    && apt-get clean \ 
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/ \ 
    && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/ /tmp/*.rds
    
## Install packages from CRAN
RUN install2.r --error \ 
    -r 'http://cran.rstudio.com' \
    googleAuthR \
    ## clean up
    && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/ /tmp/*.rds

## assume shiny app is in build folder /shiny
COPY ./shiny/ /srv/shiny-server/myapp/

```

Note the `COPY` command at the end - this copies from a folder in the same location as the `Dockerfile`. and then places it in the `/srv/shiny-server/` folder which is the default location for Shiny apps - this location means that the Shiny app will be avialable at `your.ip.addr.ess/myapp/`

We also install `googleAuthR` from CRAN, and a Debian dependency for `googleAuthR` that is needed, `libssl-dev` via `apt-get`.


The file structure for the build is then:
```
list.files(get_dockerfolder("shiny-googleAuthRdemo"), recursive = TRUE)
# "Dockerfile"        "shiny/DESCRIPTION" "shiny/readme.md"   "shiny/server.R"    "shiny/ui.R"
```

## Create your Shiny app and place in subfolder of your build folder

Create your Shiny app as normal, then place into a folder with this structure:

```
|
|- /appname/
   |
   |- ui.R
   |- server.R
| Dockerfile

```

## Start up a Shiny templated Google Compute Engine VM

Start up a Shiny templated image, which makes sure the right ports are open etc.

```r
## make new Shiny template VM for your self-contained Shiny app
vm <- gce_vm("myapp", 
             template = "shiny",
             predefined_type = "n1-standard-2")
```


## Deploy and push to the Google Container Registry via `gce_shiny_addapp`

You can now deploy your Shiny app up from your local machine:

```r
build_folder <- "~/where/your/build/folderis"
gce_shiny_addapp(vm, app_image = "gceshinygoogleauthrdemo", dockerfolder = build_folder)
``` 

This will upload the build folder, build the image, save the build Docker image to Google Container Registry (`https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/`) and start up your Shiny app. 

Your app should now be running on your IP + folder you copied into in Dockerfile, such as `http://123.456.XXX.XXX/myapp/`

## Re-deploy already built Shiny app to another VM

Now you have a built app, you can deploy it to other instances simply by leaving out the dockerfolder and using the same `app_image` argument.  This will ask the function to look on the Container Registry for the `app_image`.  

Alternativly, you could have built the image by pushing up to a GitHub repo with a set up [build trigger](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/concepts/creating-build-triggers). 

```r
vm2 <- gce_vm("myapp2", 
             template = "shiny",
             predefined_type = "n1-standard-2")

gce_shiny_addapp(vm2, app_image = "gceshinygoogleauthrdemo")
```

## Tidy up

Clean up the VMs to avoid unnecessary costs:

```r
# delete build VM
gce_vm_delete(vm)

# stop and start production shiny app as needed
gce_vm_stop(vm2)
```
