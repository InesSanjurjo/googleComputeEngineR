# Self-contained Shiny app

This creates a dedicated Docker container that has all the libraries, files and scripts necessary to run your Shiny app. 
This example uses a local `Dockerfile` to install the libraries you need, 
but in addition also copies your Shiny app scripts so its all self-contained and portable. 

The Shiny app can then be deployed on new instances.

In summary:

1. Create a build VM
2. Build your custom image with your Shiny app directory included
3. Push to the Container registry
4. Deploy to a production VM

### Create a build VM

We start with a Shiny template:

```r
library(googleComputeEngineR)

## make sure the instance is big enough to install, 
## the default "f1-micro" does not compile packages easily
vm <- gce_vm(name = "build-app", template = "shiny", predefined_type = "n1-standard-2")
```

### Build your custom image

This is as before, but the `Dockerfile` also includes a `COPY` command to copy necessary Shiny `ui.R` and `server.R` files into the Docker image. 

The Shiny app used is the [`googleAuthR` demo app](https://mark.shinyapps.io/googleAuthRexample/), and the build directory can be found via: `get_dockerfolder("shiny-googleAuthRdemo")`

```sh
FROM rocker/shiny
MAINTAINER Mark Edmondson (r@sunholo.com)

# install R package dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libssl-dev \
    ## clean up
    && apt-get clean \ 
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/ \ 
    && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/ /tmp/*.rds
    
## Install packages from CRAN
RUN install2.r --error \ 
    -r 'http://cran.rstudio.com' \
    googleAuthR \
    ## clean up
    && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/ /tmp/*.rds

## assume shiny app is in build folder /shiny
COPY ./shiny/ /srv/shiny-server/myapp/

```

Note the `COPY` command at the end - this copies from a folder in the same location as the `Dockerfile`. and then places it in the `/srv/shiny-server/` folder which is the default location for Shiny apps - this location means that the Shiny app will be avialable at `your.ip.addr.ess/myapp/`

We also install `googleAuthR` from CRAN, and a Debian dependency for `googleAuthR` that is needed, `libssl-dev` via `apt-get`.


The file structure for the build is then:
```
list.files(get_dockerfolder("shiny-googleAuthRdemo"), recursive = TRUE)
# "Dockerfile"        "shiny/DESCRIPTION" "shiny/readme.md"   "shiny/server.R"    "shiny/ui.R"
```

We now build the custom image:

```r
docker_build(vm, 
             dockerfolder = get_dockerfolder("shiny-googleAuthRdemo"),
             new_image = "shiny_gar")
```

### Push to the Container registry

On a successful build, you can now upload to the Container Registry.

```r
## push up to your private Google Container registry
gce_push_registry(vm, 
                  save_name = "shiny_gar", 
                  image_name = "shiny_gar")
# ...
# ...
# b363013633c9: Pushed
# 4809649dffb9: Pushed
# latest: digest: sha256:cb233f547d84dd94e7616fa7615522e15213d65cc2abb423dd4f3305d19309ce size: 19731
```

### Deploy

You can now deploy your Shiny app on any instance by calling it from your Container Registry:

```r
## make new Shiny template VM with your self-contained Shiny app
vm2 <- gce_vm(name = "deployedapp", 
              template = "shiny", 
              dynamic_image = gce_tag_container("shiny_gar"),
              predefined_type = "n1-standard-2")
              
## check for when image has finished downloading              
gce_check_container(vm2, "shinyserver")
# ...
# ...
# Nov 17 22:11:15 myshinyapp2 docker[1039]: [cont-init.d] done.
# Nov 17 22:11:15 myshinyapp2 docker[1039]: [services.d] starting services
# Nov 17 22:11:15 myshinyapp2 docker[1039]: [services.d] done.
``` 

Your app should now be running on your IP + folder in Dockerfile, such as `http://123.456.XXX.XXX/myapp/`

Clean up the VMs to avoid unnecessary costs:

```r
# delete build VM
gce_vm_delete(vm)

# stop and start production shiny app as needed
gce_vm_stop(vm2)
```
