## Setup

Google Compute Engine lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.  See the [documentation here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/).

Before you begin, you will need to set up a Cloud Platform project, and enable billing by adding a credit card.  

A quickstart guide is [available here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux) for making your first VM via the web interface, if you are not familiar with GCE then its best to start there.

Pricing is [available here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing).

For `googleComputeEngineR` you will need:

* Your project ID e.g. `my-project-name`
* Your preferred geographical zone to launch VMs e.g. `europe-west1-a`
* [Optional] A `Service account key` json file, downloaded from the API Manager > Credentials > Create credentials > Service account key > Key type = JSON
* [Optional] If not using service account key, you will need the `client-id` and `client-secret` for your project.

> The recommended method to authenticate is using the JSON service account key via auto-authentication.

## Authentication

### Auto-authentication

Alternatively, you can specify the location of a service account JSON file taken from your Google Project, or the location of a previously created `.httr-oauth` token in a system environment:

        Sys.setenv("GCE_AUTH_FILE" = "/fullpath/to/auth.json")

You can set default projects, zone and authentication via an `.Renviron` file or `Sys.setenv()`.

Example entries:

```
GCE_AUTH_FILE="/Users/mark/xxxxx/auth.json"
GCE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID="mark-xxxxxxx"
GCE_DEFAULT_ZONE="europe-west1-a"
GCE_SSH_USER="mark"
```

This file will then used for authentication via `gce_auth()` when you load the library:

```r
## GCE_AUTH_FILE set so auto-authentication
> library(googleComputeEngineR)
Successfully authenticated via /Users/mark/auth.json
Set default project name to 'mark-xxxxx'
Set default zone to 'europe-west1-a'

## no need for gce_auth()
> gce_get_project()
