# Run massive parallel R jobs cheaply

Due to its integration with [`future`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=future) you can run massive computing tasks using a Google Compute Engine cluster with just a few lines of code.

Some [more examples of using future](http://www.jottr.org/2017/06/the-many-faced-future.html) can be found here, using fractals as an example. 

On other platforms, see also an [Azure example here on Revolution Analytics](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/06/doazureparallel-updated.html). 

# Remote R cluster

This workflow takes advantage of the [`future`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=future) integration to run your local R-functions within a cluster of GCE machines.  
You can do this to throw up expensive computations by spinning up a cluster and tearing it down again once you are done.

In summary, this workflow:

1. Creates a GCE cluster
2. Lets you perform computations
3. Stops the VMs

### Create the cluster

The example below uses a default `r-base` template, but you can also create a `dynamic_template` pulled from the Container Registry if required.

Instead of the more generic `gce_vm()` that is used for more interactive use, we create the instances directly using `gce_vm_template()` so it doesn't wait for the job to complete before starting the next (not useful if you have a lot of VMs). You can then use `gce_get_zone_op()` to get the job status, and use `gce_wait()` to return when they are done.

```r
library(future)
library(googleComputeEngineR)

## names for your cluster
vm_names <- c("vm1","vm2","vm3")

## create the cluster using default template for r-base
## creates jobs that are creating VMs in background
jobs <- lapply(vm_names, function(x) {
    gce_vm_template(template = "r-base",
                    predefined_type = "n1-highmem-2",
                    name = x,
                    dynamic_image = my_docker),
                    wait = FALSE
                    })
jobs
# [[1]]
# ==Operation insert :  PENDING
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:52:58
# [[2]]
# ==Operation insert :  PENDING
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:53:04
# [[3]]
# ==Operation insert :  PENDING
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:53:09

## check status of jobs
lapply(jobs, gce_get_zone_op)
# [[1]]
# ==Operation insert :  DONE
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:52:58
# Ended: 2016-11-16 06:53:14 
# Operation complete in 16 secs 

# [[2]]
# ==Operation insert :  DONE
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:53:04
# Ended: 2016-11-16 06:53:20 
# Operation complete in 16 secs 

# [[3]]
# ==Operation insert :  DONE
# Started:  2016-11-16 06:53:09
# Ended: 2016-11-16 06:53:30 
# Operation complete in 21 secs


## wait for all the jobs to complete and VMs are ready
vms <- lapply(vm_names, gce_wait)


## get the VM objects
vms <- lapply(vm_names, gce_vm)
```

It is safest to setup the SSH keys seperately for multiple instances, using `gce_ssh_setup()` - this is normally called for you when you first connect to a VM.

```r
## set up SSH for the VMs
vms <- lapply(vms, gce_ssh_setup)
```

We now make the VM cluster as per details given in the [future README](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future)
```r
## make a future cluster
plan(cluster, workers = vms)
```

### Using your own Docker image

The default uses `rocker/r-base` as its image, but if you want your own custom image then create your own Docker image, for example via [this tutorial using Google Build Triggers](articles/docker.html#build-triggers).

This will give you a docker image name such as `gcr.io/my-project/my-r` - use a version of the code below to use this in your cluster:

```r
plan(cluster, workers = as.cluster(
  vms, 
  docker_image="gcr.io/my-project/my-r",
  rscript=c("docker", "run", c("--net=host","--shm-size=13G"),
			"gcr.io/my-rstudio", 
			"Rscript")))
```

### Using the cluster

The cluster is now ready to recieve jobs.  You can send them by simply using `%<-%` instead of `<-`.  Another useful function is `future::future_lapply` that lets you loop over a cluster.  Consult the [`future` documentation](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) for details. 

```r
## use %<-% to send functions to work on cluster
## See future README for details: https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future
a %<-% Sys.getpid()

## make a big function to run asynchronously
f <- function(my_data, args){
   ## ....expensive...computations
   
   result
}

## send to cluster
result %<-% f(my_data) 
```

For long running jobs you can use `future::resolved` to check on its progress.

```
## check if resolved
resolved(result)
[1] TRUE
```

## Examples

### Forecasting a large data set

The below splits a dataset into chunks that are each run on a seperate VMs, using a custom Docker image that has the necessary packages installed, for instance via [build triggers](articles/docker.html#build-triggers).  Optimise by including the package `future` in these Docker images. 

```r
library(future)
library(googleComputeEngineR)

## names for your cluster - just three for this example
vm_names <- c("vm1","vm2","vm3")

my_docker <- gce_tag_container("custom-image", project = "my-project")

## create the cluster using custom docker image
## creates jobs that are creating VMs in background
jobs <- lapply(vm_names, function(x) {
    gce_vm_template(template = "r-base",
                    predefined_type = "n1-highmem-2",
                    name = x,
                    dynamic_image = my_docker),
                    wait = FALSE
                    })
                     
## wait for all the jobs to complete and VMs are ready
vms <- lapply(vm_names, gce_wait)
                     
## set up SSH for the VMs
vms <- lapply(vms, gce_ssh_setup)  # set any settings necessary here for SSH                    

## the Rscript command that will run in the cluster
## customise as needed, this for example sets shared RAM to 13GB
my_rscript <- c("docker", 
                "run", c("--net=host","--shm-size=13G"),
                docker_image, 
                "Rscript")
                
## create the future cluster
plan(cluster, 
     workers = as.cluster(vms, 
                          docker_image=my_docker,
                          rscript=my_rscript),
                          
## create the list of data to run on the cluster
## here we assume they are in a folder of CSVs
## and there are as many files as VMs to run it upon
my_files <- list.files("myfolder")

my_data <- lapply(my_files, read.csv)

## make a big function to run asynchronously
cluster_f <- function(my_data, args = 4){
   
   forecast::forecast(forecast::auto.arima(ts(my_data, frequency = args)))
   
}

## send to cluster
result <- future::future_lapply(my_data, cluster_f, args = 4) 

## once done this will be TRUE
resolved(result)

## Your list of forecasts are now available
result
```

### Rasters in parallel

This is from @ctlamb's [GitHub issue #93](https://github.com/cloudyr/googleComputeEngineR/issues/93) which uses a custom Dockerfile to install the raster package.

The custom Dockerfile was setup in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/raster) then made into an image with these Build Trigger settings:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3155884/36549126-494a99ca-17f2-11e8-8338-f5769a629749.png)

Make sure the VMs are created in the same project as the build triggers to ensure authentication is smooth.

The example code is shown below, assuming your custom Docker image is available at `gcr.io/your-project/raster`

```r
library(raster)
library(googleComputeEngineR)
library(future)
library(SpaDES.tools)

gce_global_project("your-project")

## create raster
row <- 8
col <- 8
r <- raster(nrows=row, ncols=col,
            xmn=0, xmx=row, 
            ymn=0, ymx=col, 
            vals=c(1:(row*col)))
plot(r)

## Split
r_split <- splitRaster(r, nx=2, ny=2)

## create model
df <- data.frame(y=c(1:10),layer=c(1:5,7,6,8:10))
mod <- glm(y~layer, data=df)


## create CPUs names
vm_names <- paste0("my-server",1:2)

## made via build triggers, installed raster on custom Docker image
my_image <- gce_tag_container("raster", project = "your-project")

## start up VMs with custom Dockerfile
vms <- lapply(vm_names, gce_vm, 
              predefined_type = "n1-standard-1", 
              template = "r-base", 
              dynamic_image = my_image)

## add any ssh details, username etc.
vms <- lapply(vms, gce_ssh_setup)

## once all launched, add to cluster with custom Dockerfile
## use plan(sequential) for local testing
plan(cluster, workers = as.cluster(
  vms, 
  docker_image=my_image,
  rscript=c("docker", "run", c("--net=host"),
            my_image, 
            "Rscript")))

## make the vector of stuff to send to nodes
o <- lapply(r_split, readAll)

## the action you want to perform on the elements in the cluster
my_single_function <- function(x){
  raster::predict(x, mod)
}

#parallel - working!
result <- future_lapply(o, my_single_function)

## tidy up
lapply(vms, FUN = gce_vm_stop)

```

### Cleanup 

Remember to shut down your cluster.  You are charged per second, per instance of uptime. 

```r
## shutdown instances when finished
lapply(vms, gce_vm_stop)

```

### Pre-emptible VMs

[Preemptible VMs](https://cloud.google.com/preemptible-vms/) are a lot cheaper (80%) than normal instances, but Google reserves the right to stop them at any time.  They are intended to be used in non-critical jobs where if they shutdown you can account for it and launch another.

To create them, you need to pass `scheduling = list(preemptible = TRUE)` to `gce_vm_create()` creation family of functions. 

Make sure you can cope with the result may not be returned, so over provision the VMs and ensure your script can deal with redoing jobs if they didn't complete.


## Quotas

You can launch as many VMs as you have [quota](https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas) for in your account.  These vary from region, from ~240 to 720.  You can apply for more quota if you need it.
